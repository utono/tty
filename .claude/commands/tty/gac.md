# Git Add, Commit, Push (gac)

Perform git add, commit, and push for:

1. ~/utono/tty

## Instructions

1. Check `git status` and `git diff` to see what files have changed
2. If there are changes:
   - Run `git add .` to stage all changes
   - Analyze the changes and generate an appropriate commit message
   - Run `git commit -m "<generated message>"`
   - Run `git push`
3. If no changes, report that the repository is clean

## Commit Message Guidelines

- Summarize the nature of changes (new feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
- Keep messages concise (1-2 sentences)
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "what"
